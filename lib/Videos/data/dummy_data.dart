    steps: [
      'Rule 1:Check and identify the part of the speech:',
      'A part of speech classifies the way a word functions in a sentence. There are eight parts of speech in English Grammar: interjection, adjective, pronoun, verb, noun, preposition, adverb, and conjunction. For finding the part of speech of any sentence, check the function and role of words in a sentence.',
      'If the word is a naming word, like having a name of any place, person and so forth, then the sentence is a noun.',
      'If the word is replacing the noun, then it is the pronoun.',
      'If the word is showing an action, then it is the verb.',
      'If the word depicts the quality of a noun, then it is an adjective. ',
      'If the word is modifying the verb and adjective, it is an adverb. ',
      'If the word connects the other words, then it is a conjunction. ',
      'If the word describes the relationship between noun and pronoun, then it is a proposition.',
      'Example:  Q: Ram are playing.',
      'Ans: Here, ram is a noun and “are” is not a correct helping verb. So, correct formation of this sentence is: Ram is playing. ',
      'Rule 2: Identify the type of sentence:',
      'The three kinds of sentences in English Grammar are interrogative, affirmative, and negative sentences. If the sentence is written in the general form, with subject, verb, and object, then, the sentence is affirmative. If the sentence consists of a ‘not’ with the verb, the sentence is negative. If the helping verb of the sentence is written in the beginning or it consists of question words like why, how, where, then the sentence is interrogative.',
      'Example:Q: How are you going? ',
      'Answer: Where are you going? ',
      'Rule 3: Check the punctuation: ',
      'Punctuation plays a major role in demonstrating the exact rhythm of the paragraph. Checking commas, question marks, full stops, and other punctuations is important. If two sentences are joined to form one sentence, then they must have a comma in between to show the separation. If the sentence is ending, then it must have a full stop. And, if the sentence consists of a question word and a helping word in the beginning, then it must have a question mark.',
      'Example: Q: How are you,',
      'Answer: How are you?',
      'Rule 4: Identify the pronouns: ',
      'Pronouns are words used in place of nouns. Different types of pronouns take different nouns in the sentences, so one must know the correct pronoun while replacing a noun. ',
      'Example: Q: Ram is a boy. She is playing cricket. ',
      'Answer: Ram is a boy. He is playing cricket.',
      'Rule 5: Identify the singularity and plurality:',
      'Sentences in the English language are either singular or plural. There are specific rules to identify which sentence is singular and plural. Typically, the s/es are checked to identify the nouns and sentences as singular or plural. ',
      'Example:  Q: Many boy are dancing together. ',
      'Answer: Many boys are dancing together.',
      'Rule 6:   Always check for subject-verb agreement:',
      'If a subject is singular, then its verb should also be singular. On similar grounds, if a subject is plural, then its verb should also be plural. Furthermore,  if you write in the present tense, both the noun and the verb take plural forms in opposite ways. For instance, the noun adds an “s” to its singular form, on the other hand, the verb removes the “s” from its singular form.',
      'Rule 7: Sentences are always opposite to question tags: For example, if the question tag is positive then the sentence is negative and vice versa.',
